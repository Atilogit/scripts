# scripts
Collections of scripts I use for my university studies

This is mostly for my own use so i can't guarantee that this will work for everybody.
Modification of the source may be required to use some of the scripts.

To run a script install go and use
```
go run <scriptname>.go
```
Dependencies may be required and can be downloaded using
```
go get -u <repository url without https://>
```
